# Taxi-Service-Price-Prediction
### FCIS's Machine Learning Course Project 
---
The use of taxi service providers such as Uber, Kareem and Lyft has become almost 
essential in recent years. Each company has their own methods of pricing each ride. 
These prices may be affected by the locations or the weather. Given this dataset, our 
tasks are to predict the `price` of a taxi ride based on the provided information and classify each ride based
on `Ride Category` that is either {unknown, cheap, moderate, expensive or very expensive}.

The project is divided into two Milestones:

> Milestone 1 -> Regression
>> predict service price based on different factors such as weather state, source & destination locations, service provider, time stamp and so on ..


> Milestone 2 -> Classification
>> in this phase:
>> - The “price” column used in the previous milestone as the actual output has been removed.
>> - A New “RideCategory” column has been added instead.
>> - Each ride can have a category that is either {unknown, cheap, moderate, expensive or very expensive}
